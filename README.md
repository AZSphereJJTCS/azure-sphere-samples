# Azure Sphere Samples
This repository contains samples for the [Azure Sphere platform](https://www.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/).

## Using the samples
See the [Azure Sphere Getting Started](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/get-started/) page for details on getting an [Azure Sphere Development kit](https://aka.ms/AzureSpheredevkits) and setting up your PC for development. You should complete the [Quickstarts for Azure Sphere](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/quickstart/qs-overview) to validate your environment is configured properly before using the samples here. 

Clone this repository locally. Each folder within the samples sub directory is a self-contained sample. To use a sample open the Visual Studio solution in its folder. You can then build and deploy the sample to your Azure Sphere development kit to learn about the APIs and capabilities it is demonstrating.
